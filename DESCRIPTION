Description: A tool that imports, subsets, and exports the CongressData dataset. CongressData contains approximately 800 variables concerning all US congressional districts and covers 1789-2023. The dataset tracks district characteristics, members of Congress, and the behavior of those members in policymaking. Users with only a basic understanding of R can subset this data across multiple dimensions, export their search results, create custom aggregations (member-session) of the dataset, identify the citations associated with their searches, and more.
