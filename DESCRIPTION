Title: A Tool for CongressData
Version: 1.0
Author: Caleb Lucas (https://caleblucas.com/)
Maintainer: Caleb Lucas <calebjlucas@gmail.com>
Description: A tool that imports, subsets, and exports the CongressData dataset assembled by Matt Grossmann, Caleb Lucas, Josh McCrain, and Ian Ostrander. The CongressData contains approximately 800 variables concerning all US congressional districts and covers 1789-2021. The dataset tracks characteristics of congressional districts, the members of congress themselves, and the behavior of those members in policymaking. Users with only a basic understanding of R can subset this data across multiple dimensions, export their search results, create custom aggregations (member-session) of the dataset, identify the citations associated with their searches, and more.
