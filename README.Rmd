# congress: A Tool for the Congress Data <img src="figures/congress.png" height="150" align="right"/>

**congress** is a package designed to allow a user with only basic knowledge of R interact with *Congress Data*, a dataset that compiles information about all US congressional districts across 1789-2021. Users can find variables related to demographics, politics, and policy; subset the data across multiple dimensions; create custom aggregations of the dataset; and access citations in both plain text and BibTeX for every variable. An associated web application is available [here](https://congress.ippsr.msu.edu/congress/) and the data-only package is [here](https://github.com/IPPSR/congressData).

## Read the Manual

The package's manual contains information regarding each function and its arguments. It is available here: [congress manual](congress_1.0_manual.pdf)

## Installing this Package and the Data-only Companion Package

`congress` is a functional package that interacts with Congress Data. We maintain the dataset in another package called `congressData`. You can use the data-only package if you simply want to access the data. Install them from GitHub like so:

```{r eval=F}

# use the devtools library to download the package from GitHub
library(devtools)

# this will download congressData as well (NOTE: installation can take several minutes)
install_github("ippsr/congress")

# if there are issues or you only want to download congressData (NOTE: installation can take several minutes)
install_github("ippsr/congressData")

```

## Finding Variables

`get_var_info`: Retrieve information regarding variables in Congress Data and identify variables of interest with `get_var_info`. The function allows you to search to codebook to find the years each variable is observed in the data; a short and long description of each variable; and the source and citation/s for each variable. Citations are available in both bibtex and plain text. Use the function to search for broad terms like 'tax' with the `related_to` argument and/or partial-match variable names with `var_names`.

```{r}

suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
library(congress)

# variables related to health insurance
h_ins_cong <- get_var_info(related_to = "health insurance")

cat("There are",nrow(h_ins_cong),"variables related to health insurance in Congress Data")

head(h_ins_cong$variable)

# variables with 'under18' in their name
under18_cong <- get_var_info(var_names = "under18")

head(under18_cong$variable)

```

`get_var_info` returns the following information to simplify using Congress Data: 

- variable: Variable name
- year: The prescise years the variable is observed
- short_desc: A short description of the variable
- long_desc: A long description of the variable
- source: The sources of the data
- category: the variable's category (not all are coded)
- plaintext_cite (1-4): Plain text citations for the data
- bibtext_cite (1-4): BibTeX citation for the data

## Accessing Member-Year Data

`get_cong_data`: Access all or a part of Congress Data with `get_cong_data`. Subset by state names with `state` and years with `years` (either a single year or a two-year vector that represents the min/max of what you want). You can also use the `related_to` argument to search across variable names, short/long descriptions from the codebook, and citations for non-exact matches of a supplied term. For example, searching 'tax' will return variables with words like 'taxes' and 'taxable' in any of those columns. 

```{r}

# return the entire dataset
all_the_dat <- get_cong_data()

# subset by state, topic, and years
cong_subset <- get_cong_data(states = c("Kentucky","Michigan","Pennsylvania")
                             ,related_to = "tax"
                             ,years = c(1960,1980)
                             )

```

## Aggregate to Member-Session Data with Custom Schemes

`aggregate_cong_dat`: Choose how to aggregate the member-year data into member-session data across subsets (e.g. data sources) of Congress Data. You can choose either `Mean` or `Sum` or `First` (meaning first year in the session value) to aggregat the following chunks of the dataset:

- census_nonperc_vars: Non percent Census Variables
- census_perc_vars Percent Census Variables
- bill_vars: Congressional Bills Project Variables
- com_vars: Committee Assignment Variables
- else_vars: All the Other Variables

The variable names in the resulting dataset will reflect how they were aggregated (e.g. `nbills_major_topic_10` becomes `nbills_major_topic_10_mean`). Note: while character variables will reflect the chosen aggregation scheme (e.g. `character_var_sum`), they are aggregated by pasting their unique values together.

```{r}

# import the data using the default mean values
agg_cong <- aggregate_cong_dat()

# choose specific aggregation methods by subgroup
cong_custom <- aggregate_cong_dat(census_nonperc_vars = "Mean"
                                  ,census_perc_vars = "Sum"
                                  ,bill_vars = "First"
                                  ,com_vars = "Mean"
                                  ,else_vars = "Sum")

# default aggs for specific states/sessions and vars related to health
cong_subset <- aggregate_cong_dat(states = c("Kentucky","Michigan","Pennsylvania")
                                  ,related_to = "health"
                                  ,sessions = c(50:55)
                                  )

```

## Pulling Citations

`get_var_info`: Each variable in Congress Data was collected from external sources, please use `get_var_info` to obtain their citations (plain text and BibTeX). We've made it easy to cite the source of each variable you use with the `get_var_info` function described above. Supply a vector of variable names to the function with the `var_names` function and collect the citations provided in the plain text or BibTeX columns. NOTE: Some variables have multiple citations, so do check you have them all.

```{r}

# bibtex is also available
get_var_info(var_names = "com_benghazi_299") %>%
  pull(plaintext_cite)

# bibtex is also available
get_var_info(var_names = "percent_bus") %>%
  pull(plaintext_cite)

```

# Citation

In addition to citing each variable's source, we ask that you cite Congress Data if use this package or the dataset. A recommended citation is below.
