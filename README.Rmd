# congress: A Tool for the Congress Data <img src="figures/congress.png" height="150" align="right"/>

**congress** is a package designed to allow a user with only basic knowledge of R interact with *Congress Data*, a dataset that compiles information about all US congressional districts across 1789-2021. Users can find variables related to demographics, politics, and policy; subset the data across multiple dimensions; and access citations in both plain text and BibTeX for every variable. An associated web application is available [here](https://congress.ippsr.msu.edu/congress/) and the data-only package is [here](https://github.com/IPPSR/congressData).

## Read the Manual

The package's manual contains information regarding each function and its arguments. It is available here: [congress manual](congress_1.0_manual.pdf)

## Installing this Package and the Data-only Companion Package

`congress` is a functional package that interacts with Congress Data. We maintain the dataset in another package called `congressData`. You can use the data-only package if you simply want to access the data.

We do not plan on moving these packages to CRAN in the immediate future, so install them from GitHub like so:

```{r eval=F}

# use the devtools library to download the package from GitHub
library(devtools)

# this should download congressData as well
devtools::install_github("ippsr/congress")

# if there are issue or you only want to download congressData
devtools::install_github("ippsr/congressData")

```

## Finding Variables

`get_var_info`: Retrieve information regarding variables in Congress Data and identify variables of interest with `get_var_info`. The function allows you to search to codebook to find the years each variable is observed in the data; a short and long description of each variable; and the source and citation/s for each variable. Citations are available in both bibtex and plain text. Use the function to search for broad terms like 'tax' with the `related_to` argument and/or partial-match variable names with `var_names`.

## Accessing Data

`get_congress_data`: Access all or a part of Congress Data with `get_congress_data`. Subset by state names with `state` and years with `years` (either a single year or a two-year vector that represents the min/max of what you want). You can also use the `related_to` argument to search across variable names, short/long descriptions from the codebook, and citations for non-exact matches of a supplied term. For example, searching 'tax' will return variables with words like 'taxes' and 'taxable' in any of those columns. 

## Pulling Citations

`get_var_info`: Each variable in Congress Data was collected from external sources, please use `get_var_info` to obtain their citations. We've made it easy to cite the source of each variable you use with the `get_var_info` function described above. Supply a vector of variable names to the function with the `var_names` function and collect the citations provided in the plain text or BibTeX columns.

# Citation

In addition to citing each variable's source, we ask that you cite Congress Data if use it or this package. A recommended citation is below.
